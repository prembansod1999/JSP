# JSP: Jakarta Server Pages (JSP; formerly JavaServer Pages) 

1. JSP is extension of servlet technology but jsp provides more functionality than the servlet.

JSp supports multiple language with .jsp extension.

1. html
2. css
3. javascript
4. java

<%= %> this tag is used to write java code in the jsp page.

# Disadvantage of servlet:

1. static content are generated by java from inside servlet.
Designing servlet is difficult.

2. For every request in servlet you have to write the service method. which is very tidious process.
3. whenever modification is made in static content servlet needs to recompile and redeploy.

<% 
	Java Source Code
%>
